## 🔐 Overview

This is a high-security, modular ERP system designed from the ground up in **native C++**.  
This repository contains architecture documents, security protocols, licensing strategies, and encryption design for the system — **not the source code**.

### ✨ Core Features

- ✅ **Modular Architecture**  
  Plugin-based encrypted DLL modules that can be activated/deactivated in real time.

- 🔒 **Zero-Trust Security Model**  
  Built-in license verification, hardware-bound activation, and in-memory decryption.

- 🔁 **End-to-End Encrypted Communication**  
  Uses the **Double Ratchet Algorithm** to ensure forward and future secrecy.

- 🧠 **Real-Time Multi-User Collaboration**  
  Secure client-server architecture enables collaborative, event-driven ERP operations.

- ⚙️ **Dynamic License Management**  
  Admin-controlled activation/deactivation of modules, synced via encrypted license blobs.
